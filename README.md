Tool 1: PESTLE Analysis -> A Tool for Business Analysis

        PESTLE analysis, which is sometimes referred as PEST analysis, is a concept in marketing principles. Moreover, this concept is 
        used as a tool by companies to track the environment they’re operating in or are planning to launch a new project/product/service 
        etc.

        PESTLE is a mnemonic which in its expanded form denotes P for Political, E for Economic, S for Social, T for Technological, L for Legal
        and E for Environmental. It gives a bird’s eye view of the whole environment from many different angles that one wants to check and 
        keep a track of while contemplating on a certain idea/plan.
